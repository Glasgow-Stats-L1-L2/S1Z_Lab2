# Coping With Surgery {-}

## Context {-}

Patients undergoing any surgical procedure often show signs of anxiety.  A psychologist has conducted a study, in which surgical patients have been randomly allocated to one of four different therapy methods.

Each patient has been scored before the therapy begins and after the conclusion of the therapy. Low scores indicate the presence of anxiety and so an **increase** in score represents an **improvement** in a patientâ€™s condition.

## Research Questions {-}

Is there evidence that any of the therapy methods is more effective in increasing the average score of patients? In other words,

1)	On average, is there any evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the therapy methods?
2) 	If so, which therapy methods are likely to differ? And by how much?

## Data {-}

The data contains the following variables:

* **INITIAL** : initial score	
* **FINAL** : final score	 
* **TREAT** : treatment group coded as a number
    + 1 - Control
    + 2 - Behavioural
    + 3 - Drug
    + 4 - Aversion
* **RESPONSE** : final score - initial score
* **TYPE** : a text version of **TREAT**, i.e., a short description of the treatment
 
## Importing the Data {-}

The data to be analyzed are saved in a dataframe object called `surgery` which can be imported using the following code.

```{r import_data, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
surgery <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenVillejo/S1Z.AnovaLab/main/surgery.csv"))
surgery
```

You may also download the dataset named `surgery.csv` file from our Moodle course page. Save the file in your local computer and then use the `read.csv()` function to import the data in your R. You can load the data set into your workspace by running the code below in an Rscript file in your local Rstudio. Make sure that the `surgery.csv` file is saved in the same folder as the Rscript file.
