## Context {-}

Patients undergoing any surgical procedure often show signs of anxiety.  A psychologist has conducted a study, in which surgical patients have been randomly allocated to one of four different therapy methods.

Each patient has been scored before the therapy begins and after the conclusion of the therapy. Low scores indicate the presence of anxiety and so an **increase** in score represents an **improvement** in a patientâ€™s condition.

## Research Questions {-}

Is there evidence that any of the therapy methods is more effective in increasing the average score of patients? In other words,

1)	On average, is there any evidence of a difference in the effectiveness of the therapy methods?
2) 	If so, which therapy methods are likely to differ? And by how much?

## Data {-}

The data contains the following variables:

* **INITIAL** : initial score	
* **FINAL** : final score	 
* **TREAT** : treatment group coded as a number
    + 1 - Control
    + 2 - Behavioural
    + 3 - Drug
    + 4 - Aversion
* **RESPONSE** : final score - initial score
* **TYPE** : a text version of **TREAT**, i.e., a short description of the treatment
 
You can download a .csv file of the data from our Moodle page. The filename is `surgery.csv`.
